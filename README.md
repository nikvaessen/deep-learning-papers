# Learning to dive deep into academic literature

I use this repository to document my "deep dive" (:D) into the deep learning 
literature.
I'm starting this repository as a way to document the literature review required
by my master thesis in a systematic way.
I would like to thank 
[Patrick Liu](https://github.com/patrick-llgc/Learning-Deep-Learning) for 
inspiring  me to make this repository.

Each paper I read should be accompanied by some notes explaining what I've
learned from the paper.
I will follow a (slightly) modified version of 
[this guide](https://be.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/HowToReadAScientificPaper.pdf)
on how to read a scientific paper. Therefore, I will indicate a rough guideline
of how much time I spent on each paper to indicate what questions have and have
not been answered in the summary.

To make it as easy as possible to stick to this level of self-documentation 
this repository contains 2 helpful scripts which generate a baseline summary 
to the repository and can edit this README. See `scripts/new_summary.py` and `scripts/update_readme.py`.
Feel free to fork and re-use :)!

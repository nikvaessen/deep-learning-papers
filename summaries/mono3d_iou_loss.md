### Abstract

__*What questions are the authors addressing?*__

* Can we develop a method to do 3d mono obj detection with is fast and accurate?
* Does modeling heteroscedastic uncertainty improve performance?
* Can the system be learned end-to-end?

__*What is the major finding or scientific contribution?*__

Presenting a 3d mono obj detection framework which can run at 20 FPS and has state-of-the-art performance (2019)

__*What is the work's significance?*__

Present a simple framework for mono 3d obj det

### Materials and Methods

__*What is their experimental methodology or developed system?*__

__*If there are alternative approaches, how did they select this system?*__

__*What would I do differently?*__

### Results

__*What are the conclusions they draw from the data?*__

__*How do these results answer the greater question identified in the abstract?*__

__*Do the results lead to the final claims of the paper?*__

### Figures, Tables, and Data
